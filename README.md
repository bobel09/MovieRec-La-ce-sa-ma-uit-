## About the experience 
This was a 1 day hackathon that I had the joy to participate at Haufe Timisoara , and this app was done in 6-7 hours of work . As of the experience it was great , everybody was coding and good vibes everywhere.
It was not my first Hackathon but what was interesting was the fact that it was a solo hackathon , i did not hava any teammates to rely on , usually at other hackathons there is a lot less work to do , but here I needed to do everything.

- Firebase for the database
